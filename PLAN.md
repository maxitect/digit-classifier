Set up a basic README.md file with project overview, architecture description, and setup instructions. This should be a living document that will be updated throughout development.
```

### 2. CNN Model Development

**Objective:** Create, train and validate a CNN model with at least 85% accuracy on MNIST

#### 2.1 Data Handling

- [ ] Task 2.1.1 - **Prompt:**

```

#### 3.3 Prediction API

- [ ] Task 3.3.1 - **Prompt:**

```
Add request validation, error handling, and logging to the prediction endpoint. Implement proper HTTP status codes and error messages for different failure scenarios. Include input validation for the image data format.
```

#### 3.4 Service Testing

```

#### 4.3 Logging Functionality

- [ ] Task 4.3.1 - **Prompt:**

```
Create a logging module that provides functions for storing prediction results in the database. Implement a function that takes prediction data (predicted digit, confidence score, true label) and inserts it into the predictions table. Use parameterised queries to prevent SQL injection.
```

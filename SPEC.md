## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the functional requirements and core objectives for the MNIST Digit Classifier project as part of an application to the Machine Learning Institute (MLX) programme.

### 1.2 Product Scope

The MNIST Digit Classifier is an educational project that demonstrates end-to-end machine learning application development, containerisation, and deployment. The application allows users to draw digits on a canvas, which are then classified by a trained neural network model. Results are logged to a database for potential future analysis.

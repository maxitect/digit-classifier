# Discussion History

This document records the key points from our conversation regarding the project setup and changes. Use this file to refresh the context and recall past decisions and modifications across sessions.

## Summary of Discussions

- **Project Setup and Structure**:

  - Established a three-tier architecture including `model_service`, `web_app`, and `db`.
  - Created placeholder files for key components in each tier.

- **Documentation Updates**:

  - The `README.md` was updated with a detailed project overview, architecture description, and setup instructions.
  - Configuration instructions were refined (e.g., using Streamlit for the web app).

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:

  - A PyTorch script (`model_service/src/data_loader.py`) was implemented to load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
  - Proper transformations, normalization, and data loaders for training and testing were provided.

- **Model Implementation**:

  - A CNN model class (`MNISTCNN`) was implemented in `model_service/src/model.py` designed for MNIST digit classification.

- **Training and Evaluation**:

  - A training script (`model_service/src/train.py`) was developed to train the CNN model, including validation, checkpoint saving, metric logging, and early stopping.
  - An evaluation script (`model_service/src/evaluate.py`) was implemented to assess model performance, reporting accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

- **Model Export**:

  - An export script (`model_service/src/export.py`) was added to convert the trained model into a format suitable for inference in the model service, along with necessary preprocessing functions.

- **Session Context**:
  - Notably, the conversational context does not persist between login sessions. This document serves to retain key discussion points and decisions.
